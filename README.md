# 42_philosophers
The 42 Philosophers project is a programming exercise to learn about concurrency and synchronization. Inspired by Dijkstra's philosopher problem, it simulates philosophers alternating between eating, thinking, and sleeping while avoiding deadlocks and starvation. It helps develop skills in managing threads, mutexes, and semaphores.
